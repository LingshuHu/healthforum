Dr came and out and gave me some tablets to help with acid, I just let them melt in my mouth. Took 1 and the next day the pain had dulled alot.Went to the drs again this week as was still in a little pain, mainly on the right side, just a dull ache, said it was probably Gastritis after checking my stomach area out for quite a while, pressing down and all that said she couldnt feel anything unusual. Said to keep on the tablet, but go down to 1 a day instead of 1 twice a day. and eat bland foods and I should be alright in  a few weeks.Can Gastritis be cured?I am only drinking water and eating bland foods like Pasta, spaghettio and rice. Plus eating wholemeal bread now. ,   4

It may be worth to have an h pylori stool test because this bacteria can trigger gastritis. However, before testing for h pylori, you need to be off PPIs for the test to be accurate.  1

Everyone has their own trigger foods. What upsets your stomach may be fine for someone else. The dietary guidelines for gastritis are very general and don't always fit everyone's experience. For example, they say ginger is good for digestion but for me it gives me heartburn.

I get aches all over my stomach: stabbing, dull, sore to touch and deep grinding with either constipation or diarrhoea.Try a food diary to find your triggers.  A lot of what you read is general advice on diet; it really depends on the individual.

Was caused by apples and other fruits. So pretty much cut them out and only have them now an again.The other thing is that i dont get is, what set it off? Was it down to stress and worry? Was it down to eating too much cheese in one day? Was it i had a stomach infection and then that caused it? Or a combination of them all?

You can get food reactions with both these conditions as well. H pylori can also cause gastritis so it would be worthwhile having a stool test to see if you have H pylori.  This may have been the stomach infection you originally had. This can be treated with antibiotics. Before having this test, you need to be off PPIs for two weeks to make sure the test is accurate.

Do you reckon I could heal my stomach? And then eat “tasty” foods again.I read that fizzy drinks are bad for gastritis, same with orange juice and I drank them and was fine.What does gastritis feel like? As other than the first day before my tablet. I have only had a dull ache

Everyone's food triggers are different.  What affects one person will not necessarily affect another. Try different foods to see if you react to them and then you will know what to avoid and what to include in your diet.  A food diary will help.People with gastritis mention sharp pains and burning.  I have never had gastritis; my pain is IBS.  If you have had IBS, it is possible you have had an IBS flare up as well. IBS can cause stabbing, sharp, dull pain.  IBS is chronic condition and can go into remission for a while and then come back. Sometimes it completely goes away.  Gastritis and IBS are linked to anxiety.  My IBS fiares up with stress.

Yesterday i knelt down and something made a sound in that area, but didnt think anything of it. So that could be why. Other than the first day (Wednesday) I haven’t had that sharp pain.I have made an appointment with my doctor for a week on Wednesday. So that will be 3 weeks since I started with it. (I think) booked the appointment now, just incase i cant get an appointment when i get back from my holiday.

Because Ive been having this feeling of tenderness, soreness, bloating and minor burning in stomach. The stomach feels like its dry inside... It even feels hot to the touch and bloated. I know i have gastritis but this feeling is different than before. Sometimes the stomach triggers my bowel like i have the urge to use it, sometimes i do sometimes i dont. My back is bothersome also, the lower back hurts and burning sensation. The upper and mid back has this weird feeling like a movement under the skin. Years ago i used to have fibromyalgia, these symptons really remind me of it since ive been going through perimenopause. The thing about it , it comes around same time daily.

I get bowel habit changes along with on off nausea and sometimes back pain.  I also have acid reflux which I already  had before IBS. Stress always sets it off.  Some people get bloating and food intolerance.  Luckily I have no IBS related food triggers or bloating but  I do get a lot of loud bowel gas.People with Fibromyalagia often have IBS as well.  Perimenopause can also cause stomach problems.  IBS itself can make hormonal changes worse and hormones can make IBS worse.  Anxiety plays a huge role in IBS.  The confusing thing is that everyone is different and responds to medication differently too.

Definitely try a food diary to identify trigger foods.

Other than a constant dull ache.

Try to take your mind off your pain with your hobbies and light exercise such as walking.

Forget about your pain.   This is your best course of action.  Your doctor will tell you the same thing about managing gastritis. Try to think positive thoughts and distract yourself with light exercise and your hobbies to stop your anxiety from mounting.  These things will help you.

I have been fine. The downside is eating bland. I dont drink much alcohol, i dont smoke and dont do drugs. I enjoy my food? especially breakfast, and going to the seaside and smelling the chippys is tempting IsIce creamPizzaOk to eat?I haven’t had any but seeing the variations of ice cream on offer that was tempting

Was you eating and drinking the wrong stuff pretty much every day?I dont drink much and from this will probably give up cola (even though i tried it and nothing) but i like to have a chippy tea or dhinese once in a while. And a full English, mostly grilled bar an egg. But when i had a morrisons big breakfast last Wednesday nothing

Ice cream is milk based and milk is good for your stomach so long as you are not intolerant to milk.  You could try a small amount of plain vanilla flavour to see if it agrees with your stomach.  However, ice cream should be eaten sparingly because it is fattening. With gastritis everything is trial and error. Simply try the food and if it disagrees with you, avoid it. If you have no reactions, include the food.

As other than the first day, before taking my tablet, I haven’t had much pain other than a constant dull pain on the right hand side. I have ate pretty much normal stuff for a week until my doctor said to go on a bland diet. Including a morrisons big breakfast, burger and drank lucozade and cola.

Peppers or a white sauceI brought a tuna sandwich filler, as im on holiday and didn’t realise it had peppers in it.White sauce, i did have it last week but my mum made it and i may have added too much milk. I am not lactose intolerant.

Simply avoid peppers and white sauce and anything else that causes a reaction.  Don't question your symptoms; just stick to a bland diet and watch out for food related reactions.  You already have a diagnosis, accept it and trust your doctor.  Simply work on your diet and your gastriris will get better.

If the reaction comes back, then you will know that particular food irritates your stomach and is best avoided.  Food reactions can set in at any time.and can depend on your system and the type of food. I can't digest salami because it is too fatty. I don't get an immediate reaction; it takes many hours before I start feeling the fat lying in my stomach, heartburn, sickness and sometimes vomiting.  The irritation often starts through the early hours of the morning.

Can have the sauce and pie etc but cant eat an whole apple.When I first started with ibs dr (not the one I have now) said to have more fruits and veg, so i started having an apple a day. Was only when I thought “stuff this” that i started to get better and didnt eat the apples

Some people with IBS find that certain fruits aggravate their symptoms,  particularly citrus fruits and those thar contain stones or pips. Some find that removing the skin helps.  Soluable fibre is sometimes better for IBS patients than insoluable fibre.

As i know that can irritate me. Funny though peaches dont, but i dont have them very often.Had some toast for breakfast and for dinner had a yogurt and a bacon sandwich as I didn’t want nothing in my sandwiches again. Was grilled bacon

Everyone is so different.  Probably your IBS and gastritis are acting up at the same time especially when you get anxious.

So about 9, 1 and 5. Be toast or cerel depending what i feel like bar the weekend when i have bacon and egg.Dinner, a sandwich, will be having tuna or something.Tea, various depending on day, its normallyMonday, fish or something like that, peas or beans, salad and oven chips. Tues and thurs veg and something, friday salad and chicken. Sat roughly the same as mon, Sunday roast. Today had beef, mushroom gravy, stuffing, peas, sweetcorn, carrots, roast potatoes, potatoesand broccoli. For breakfast had a “new” item, black pudding (oven cooked) was nice.I have made some differences to my diet, as i would normally fry like bacon and the black pudding, and have a fried egg. Now either doing them in oven or grill them. And having poached egg.

I have finished with my tablets now.Been to the drs today, told her that i have got some discomfort when lyong on my right side or stretching. She thinks that it is more muscular than anything as from being sick probably pulled the area and then going about doing stuff and generally stretching etc it probably hasnt fully healed. She checked my stomach area and my side/ back and again couldn’t feel anything abnormal. She recommended that I wait a little longer and if no improvements go back and see her for a blood test. They were the two options, i said id wait a little longer as things have improved from a dull constant ache to discomfort every now and then. I asked what  could have caused the inflammation and said it is highly likely to do with the stomach virus i had. I am now eating 3 times a day and drink at leadt 4 glasses if water a day as well.

Cant get in on the Wednesday, unless someone cancels. Good thing is it’s in the morning so if i need to have blood tests i can walk straight up and get them done.The discomfort feels just below the rib cage in the centre. I am not currently prescribed anything. I am taking antiacids that dont do anything and today i have used pepto bismal. Not sure if that is doing anything. I could have just pulled the area again when i heaved on monday as it came on after that and the area may not have fully healed. Plus, from about wed last week i was fine until the monday.I haven’t eaten anything different either. Salads, stew, pasta and spag bol. Ill keep checking to see if i can get an earlier appointment but i know ive got one, at least.

Plus, from about wed last week i was fine until the monday.I haven’t eaten anything different either. Salads, stew, pasta and spag Ill keep checking to see if i can get an earlier appointment but i know ive got one, at least.Ive put some deep heat in the area of discomfort. Think i will go back to a bland diet of rice, spaghetti, chicken and veg.Putting deep heat on as actually helped a little. Which is more muscular base. At the moment anyway.Hopefully feel better in the morning

If you pulled muscles, take painkillers and wait it out. Twists and strains take time to heal. Last Wednesday I tripped and almost fell when I caught my foot on slatted stairs. I still have some residual aches and pains.  You will be able to get a different PPI or antacid from your doctor since the ones you are currently taking are not working. If you anxious, your symptoms will feel worse. Try distraction techniques again to help you forget about your stomach.

Sometimes it hurts when ive swallowed food or water.Bland diet again started yesterday, i had tagliatelle and soup for dinner and today had something for breakfast l, cant remember what now. Tuna sandwich for dinner And spag bol for tea.I am anxious about it again as this pain hasnt dulled or gone a way since Monday, Thursday it only cane after i drank somethjng. I did notice if i sip a drink i get either a little discomfort or none at all but if I gulp it down say take a fw mouth fulla of water i can feel it. Im hoping i can get into see my dr earlier next week.I wouldn’t mind to know what caused the stomach infection to begin with that led to this.Hopefully get some news next week And  help  put my mind at rest.I nearly sure ill be sent for a blood test, which im not that bothered about as ive had them before and watch them get the blood. Then its the general waiting after. . . But after seeing the dr it helps, plus if she gives me some tablets to take thatll help as well

It is likely that your anxiety played a part in the gastritis so you should ask your doctor for help such as CBT to manage your stress levels. The more you worry, the worse your gastritis will be.  Diet and stress management are the key to healing gastritis. My IBS is in remission because I try to avoid stressful situations.

When i was told i had ibs i read that fruit would help, so i was eating an apple a day and wasn’t improving, finally i thought stuff it, didnt eat them and was back to normal shortly after.Is it possible that i was healing up, but when i heaved on monday i pulled everything again?

Try hobbies and light exercise daily to distract your mind from your stomach since this helps your pain and anxiety.   Once again ask for CBT. You have noticed that when you concentrate on your pain, it triggers anxiety and then more pain.  Tackling your chronic anxiety is crucial in healing your gastritis.  Trust your doctor, accept your diagnosis of gastritis, eat a bland diet and stop worrying. Forget about your stomach and pulled muscles.  If you pulled a muscle with heaving it will heal.  When I pulled muscles, it was annoying.  However, I  waited the pain out, carried out my daily activities and didn't worry about it and in the end the pain cleared up. We all pull muscles from time to time; this is normal and nothing to worry about.  Stay positive.

I just couldnt nod off at all.Good thing is i have 2 new video games to play and a new one coming next week.Today i am going to try and drink between 4-6 glasses of water as I have not really been drinking that much compared with last week.At the moment I feel quite bloated, so hopefully thatbwill go away when i need the toilet.I think what i have done is pulled the muscle ms around mybrib cage and thats more of the pain. Maybe anyway.

Would you be able to explain the difference please? I tried nexium, which made no difference and now on somac. I also have ranitidine in the the cupboard and wondering whether that might help me more. I have reflux and gastritis and it is diving me crazy!Thanks

Drinks I have had 3 sips of fizzy pop since this, no alcohol. Benn drinking a Yakult but dont know if thats helping or not .

So that has made me worry a little bit, however, Im not sure it was just how I was sitting and the water bottle dug into me. Last less than a second, but then got a cold sweat after. I have been eating normally and no problems.

I have had a slight worry about not being well on Christmas day for quite some time. Think it has been down to in 2010 I had a headache all day due to not sleeping very well, then 2011 getting a headache throughout the day, then the year after having an upset stomach. so  just had a slight worry because of that. Iits not because of me being ill its because my grand parents put a lot of effort and dont want to let them down by not eating as much. Plus having a cold doesnt help at the moment, went to bed last night early, trying to get to sleep, started nodding off after an hour and a half of trying and then my brother went to bed and woke me up again.

If I have a flare up, I take medication immediately and my symptoms go away.   The same is true of gastritis. Simply avoid any food triggers and eat in moderation. Don’t worry about disappointing others.  Stay positive and tell yourself that will enjoy Christmas.

I could have just pulled a muscle in that area due to sneezing and coughing.I have made an appointment with my dr for next week, just in case, plus it is the only one before Christmas.Got a water bottle on the area. When i felt the area earlier did feel a little tender.But what doesn’t help is having a cold as that could be playing a part in it as well. Hopefully when i see the dr she will give me some of them tablets. I have been off them since early November and haven’t had any trouble since then until today.  But i have a cold Doesn’t get an worse after eating or drinking. Doesn’t feel like in my stomach just under the rib cage centre and just a dull ache. I haven’t been sleeping very well either. Last week i could not get to sleep, one night it was after 2am before i managed to nod off, then awake again at 5. Last night, i could not get to sleep either l, I could not get comfy and when i did my nose started running. I had a blood test when i last visited my dr and everything was normal, nothing wrong at all. Which mustve been over 8 weeks ago as i waited 2 weeks before i got the results and then put it up on here about a month ago.Hopefully feel better tomorrow

Gastritis can come and go.  I think it is more likely that. If it was just a pulled muscle, omeprazole would not help. A PPI only helps stomach conditions.  Since you also have IBS, you could also be having an IBS flare up too.  I would try to forget about your stomach and try to relax and your pain will go away.

And that i can deal with, with just 1 over the countet anti acids and its fine after.As i have been watching tv, I haven’t felt any pain. No additional pain from eating or drinking. Probably a slight flare up from having a cold. Like i said ive been fine for a while now. Pretty sure that the pain on the right side under my rib was just a pulled muscle as i do tend to stretch and feel it in that area, plus it hasnt been that bad as well.Could having a cold made the flare up from the mucus

For it to be a pulled muscle, you would have to be stretching very vigourously to cause pain. Simple stretching should not cause these problems. I still think the cause of your pain is either gastritis or IBS or both triggered by anxiety.  You mentioned your anxiety over eating Christmas dinner because you were worried about disappointing relatives if you couldn’t eat.  This worrying will cause your stomach to flare up.  When I have a build up of anxiety, my IBS flares up immediately.Once again, try distraction techniques to take your mind of your pain and worries. Anxiety is the root of your problem. Try to think positively.

Nothing major, just every now and then.How was you diagnosed?  Other than a blood test I haven’t had anything test wise any way

Your blood test showed nothing which is good news for you.I had stool tests, urine test, celiac test and an ultrasound and nothing showed up.  So I was diagnosed with IBS.  WIth IBS, norhing will show on any scans.  The best thing you can do is to relax since you already have a disgnosis of IBS and gastritis. Calmness will help your pain.

I have kept away from spicy things, I tend not to eat a lot of spicy foods anyway, I have had spicy chicken with no problems at all. Only had 1 bit of slight discomfort which went away after an hour and that was  having a big gulp of cola,  But I have had sips of pop since then with nothing. Only had he cola because I had gone to see The Killers and my throat was dry. I bet I havent had a whisky glass full of pop in total since September. Just been drinking tea, water and milk and on a friday i have been having dilute lemon & barley. I thought Gastritis affects your stomach more, my pain in is central below my rib cage.

The general area just under my rib cage is tender to touch. I have put deep heat on the area just to see if that helps in anyway. Antiacids have had Zero effect. Do you thibk gaviscon could help? I would get the double action one as it doesnt feel like a burning sensation just a dull ache and doesn’t feel in my stomach. I had no trouble eating or drinking, it didnt hurt more or less.

Worst thing, it doesn’t do anything to help best thing it helps.I reckon having a cold has brought this on, just weird how and when it came on again, just sat down on the computer and felt it, didn’t know if it was the pain or water bottle digging in me, cold sweat , and its back. Othet than the dull pain, nothing else is wrong, going to the toilet fine, eating fine, feeling hungry, stools normal etc

I have done some Christmas shopping too.  I’m definitely in Christmas mode.

I think it is down to growing up, as now my brother is older and getting things similar to me, like music, dvds etc so the "magic" around gift giving isnt really there anymore, like to see his face light up due to a present.Plus the entertainment over Christmas isnt looking that great, tv wise, I am probably only going ot try and watch one program which is on about a week before Christmas. The movies that are on, the ones I would actually watch are the ones I own on DVD and blu ray. But I do like spending time with my family, even thought when it is all over, Christmas day and boxing day, I am glad it is all over. Im trying not to think of Christmas Day at the moment, as it makes me worried about the food, due to this pain, even though I have been eating normally.I did nipo to the chemist to get some Gaviscon Double action Liquid, I havent had any yet, but only just had tea and want to wait 30 mins after.I havent had much pain today, until I had a cup of tea and felt it after. Hopefully the gaviscon will help. I havent been wanting to eat, but that is down to my cold, which is going. got over 1 week before I see the doctor, but glad I have managed to get an appointment, even if it is late evening. The next appoint is on the 28th. I keep looking on the website to see if an earlier one becomes available.  A good thing is I checked my weight today, and I have not lost any weight, and going to the toilet is normal, and dont feel sick after food. Plus the blood test came back normal.  Which is all good.

Aim to enjoy your food. Worry will guarantee that your pain will flare up.

Touching wood, today hasnt been that bad, I have been having Gaviscon and does appear to be helping a little bit. I havent had the full 20ml yet, yesterday I had 10ml after tea, and then 10-15ml (I split some putting on the spoon) before bed. After I had something to eat I had 5ml and 5ml before I saw Star Wars. Will have some more after pizza or bedtime. I am hungry now, but dont fully feel like wanting to eat, but that is down to my cold, which is getting better day by dayBUT I have managed to get another Doctors appointment, instead of Thursday 22nd it is Monday 18th, which I am pleased about.

Try a food diary to identify the culprit.  Gastritis can be chronic. Stick to bland foods and avoid anything spicy, rich or fatty as your doctor previously advised you.

And then talk about what to do. Because its Christmas week, And then new year coming, i dont know if i need to go to the hospital for a scan or camera down my throat it will be this year, so may have tablets to help out over the Christmas.

That is why a food diary would still help to identify it. Your IBS could be also causing you problems as well as the gastritis.  Your anxiety is also a very likely trigger as well.

Deffo think my cold did not help either and set it off

Gastritis and IBS are long term intestinal disorders and can reoccur from time to time.  The best thing you can do is to learn to manage both you conditions with diet and stress management techniques.  I have the cold too but my stomach is fine and I have no anxiety at the moment.

Told her everything and said she thinks it is acid reflux, due to the location and that is why I am getting the soreness, plus the reason the Gaviscon it working a little bit. Said dont think it is anything more severe as the blood test came back clear on everything, with no signs of infection or inflammation.Gave me the same tablets I was on last time, but this time, I believe they are a stronger dosage and I should only take one a day when and needed, as your body can start depending on them.he said there is also one more test she would like to do before having the camera down my throat, and that is a stool test to check for a bacteria in the stomach. I need to do that before having the tablets. If there is anything she will phone me up and go from there.

In the mean time I have the tablets, which are different from the others as the others I took after food, these ones I take before food.

You need to be off antacid medications such Gaviscon and PPIs for two weeks to make sure your test is accurate.

The Doctor did say not to take the tablet until I have done the stool test and asked about other medications, and said about the gaviscon, but that wouldnt matter. So I have not taken any medication today, as I thought by the time I did the test it was mid afternoon. Will start tomorrow with them. Can start to relax a little bit. Got a few things planned in the evening this week, going to watch the extended version of the hobbit and the lord of the rings, 1 a day.

I never upgraded because you have to swap disks half of way through, it spoils it. Hopefully Amazon dont remake either of them but do a story in the same world.

It was brought on by years of anti-inflammatory use, probably too much alcohol, and spicy foods. It came to a peek and landed me in hospital after a very stressful few months. So here I am now eight weeks after I was in the hospital and I feel no better. I am on a PPI called tactor which I think is making the gastritis a little better, but the nausea, abdominal pain and back pain are horrific. How do you manage your gastritis? I really need some positive reinforcement that one day this will all be over and behind me and I will be healthy again…
#> 153 Hi Julia - I had mild chronic gastritis 5 years ago - nausea was constant and lost weight through it coz could not eat.  I had PPI for a month but it did not help.  I went the natural route with:  Tumeric caps, manuka honey, silicol gell (coats the tum and pushes out toxins) I toned down my diet by no spices, no citrus nor tomatoes, eat mainly chicken,fish,loads of prawns, oatmeal and mashed banana for breakfast.  If you can take it Apple Cider Vinegar, in glass of warm water.  Lemon is supposed to help digestion but it hurt me.  I cut down alcohol but not out (red wine still in).  I did get rid of it completely for ages and ages (so take heart it can be done) but I do think once you have it it decides it likes you and want to move in.  But you will find things which give it a boot out of your body.  It is trial and error but can be done.  I was fine until about 18 months ago and started with pain again in left rib side and up my chest which goes into my back and throat.  Sometimes I wake at night with reflux in my mouth which is a bit scary (this is LPR or silent reflux). Anyway I went for the camera job second time round and it is a Hiatus Hernia/Esophagitis/LPR/GERD.  Lovely Jubly but it is my own fault.  Because I was so much better for so long I hammered the booze, spices, you name it, curries, the works.  Which now I know is ok in small doses, you can get away with it, but keep doing it and it bring it back.I now have good days when I think it has gone, no pain at all, and other days it is there.  A food diary did not help me as something that would not hurt then suddenly did!!!!I have tried all sorts that peeps have suggested like Slippery Elm, DL liquorice and others but they hurt.  You have to try to find out.This time round I turned down PPI and have 150mg Ranitidine morning and before bed along with Pepzin taken 30 mins apart.  I also take Mastic Gum before bed.  I don't usually have to resort to Gaviscon but I keep it in in case as it acts as a barrier mesh and lines your tum to protect it. Today and the last 4 days have been pain free and I had a roast dinner yesterday and wine with no pain at all.  Take heart, you are early days and will definitely find something that suddenly starts working. G.p.s.  I have also started Kefir probitic drink which is active with millions of healthy bacteria and also a good quality probiotic I got off the net, I do seem to be getting better each day with it.

I think doc put me on it to heal the gastritis (less acid to irritate the lining= healing). But with no acid in there, my gut not emptying as fast and now I just feel "sick, bloated" all day. And the back pain OMG! Almost feel more reflux now than before because my stomach always full. Did you experience this? How long did you need to stay on the PPI and did it do its job do you think? Considering tapering of slowly from today until I see my doc in 5 days.....

So been feeling a lot better no problems until Saturday, when I had a good stretch in bed and felt something go, under the ribs, and since then had some discomfort in that area.

Did you get the results of your h pylori test?

I would chase this up.  Your doctor would always get back to you whether the result was positive or negative. Only bother about the pain if it continues or gets worse.  Other than that, just relax.  Pulled muscles clear up

When I was ill in Sept I felt something go then in the same area due to throwing up. And at the same time I had acid reflux so thought it was all 1. But with the acid reflux I have only felt a slight pain and it was very slight over Christmas and that was down to having something very rich. And that pAin was central, this pulled muscle pain is in the right

Its when I first wake up, so half a sleep and have a stretch and can feel it go. It is a painful muscle to pull. I will keep putting deep heat or the ice one (which ever we have) to try and ease it and make it get better.

Other than that, try a heat pad or take painkillers like nurofen. Pulled muscles do heal; it is likely to go away on its own without any intervention. I pulled my shoulder last September and it took six weeks to clear up which is the normal timescale.  I waited it out and it went away.  We can all pull muscles from time, the trick is not to allow it to worry you. Worry will only flare up your gastritis and IBS.I have neuropathic injuries in both arms and I am trying natural remedies but so far nothing is working. So I am preparing to just learn to live with the pain.

I had a hot bath, inwas falling a sleep so must’ve been relaxed yesterday. Also had a hot water bottle on the area and then before I went to sleep i put deep heat on the area.I think some of the ache is in my mind asvi am worried about being ill again like i was in September, as the ache is near my stomach, but i keep telling myself its a pulled muscle

Pulled muscles are nothing to worry about; try to forget about it.

Just to try and heal it

If you are on a PPI and you come off them too quickly you can get acid rebound.  If you want to come off them, you have to do it slowly and then replace them with an over the counter antacid  to keep the heartburn at bay.  Eat little but often and avoid heartburn triggers such as rich, spicy and fatty foods and don’t eat late at night.Try to relax and enjoy your hobbies and go out with friends.  If you concentrate too much on your pain and heartburn, you can end up making your symptoms worse.  I have chronic neuralgia and heartburn.but I find if I concentate on my hobbies and going to my writing clubs, I can live with these conditions even though they can be very annoying.  My IBS is in remisdion because, I am trying to stay relaxed.

But deffo got the pain back centre. I had started to come off them by taking one a day miss a day but then the muscle strain i didnt want to risk it. But the pain came back anyway

If anxiety triggered these conditions, it is likely that you will always have flare ups.  You will have to accept this and learn to manage your stomach problems.  The best you can do is to try and relax as much as possible, take your heartburn meds, and watch your diet.  This is how to live with it.

Think it irritated my stomach. IBS hasnt played up in quite a while now. Could manage that with over the counter antibacids. Would normally only take 1

Nothing much and then every so often feels like a stinging pain

This is all you can do for it; you will have to learn to live with a sensitive stomach. Concentrate on managing your symptoms.  The best I can do for my stomach conditions is to manage them  with medication, diet and relaxation and to realise that my symptoms will flare up from time to time and to accept this.

I think I have found something else that doesn’t agree with me and that is red onion, as i had some over the weekend and yesterday

Like an achey pain, thats even with the tablet.Not sure if I should go back to the doctors. Just for check up or reassurance.

This is the best thing to do for gastritis.  Your doctor is likely to suggest this too.  A food diary may take some time to identify the problem food.  Eliminating red onions and anything else you know of that irritates your stomach will help you.  It’s good you  have found one trigger.

The earliest I could get in to see my regular one. Just looked again and the earliest is mid February now do got lucky with that. Plus its a morning appointment.Still got a stingy dull ache, worse today than yesterday. Yesterday I had no problems at all other than pulled stomach muscles but that eased by late morning.I am not sure if the tomato bolognese sauce is an irritant, as I have noticed that I sometimes feel more pain after having that BUT not every time. Still taking my tablets.

If you find you are still having on off reactions, stay off tomato bolognese sauce completely.Sometimes PPI medications cause stomach pains so it is possible you are reacting to that . Check the list of side effects on the patient leaflet to see if stomach pain is listed or check online.  Ask your doctor about this.  You may be better off switching to an OTC H2 blocker instead.

Which I found odd. As the ones before said take 30mins after food. I can ask about them next week. Its like a general tightness just under  the rib cage

Avoid rich, fatty and spicy foods, eat blandly and little but often, and avoid all your trigger foods. Reduce your stress levels and/or take a PPI to reduce acid.  You will have to follow these guidlines strictly to give your stomach the best chance of healing.

I still think I am questioning whether it is Gastritis or something else. Even though I know I should just trust the doctor. I think it is from the tablets as at the start, after a few days it eased and got better, now they do not appear to be doing anything.Either way I have been avoiding rich, spicy and fatty foods. I dont think generally I eat that much of them anyway, deffo not spicy food. I think generally I have a balanced diet, probably more leaning into healthy diet since this time last year.Its funny because Back when I first started with IBS I was trying to lose weight and exercise back between 2010-2012 ish. I did lose some, and then last year, started losing weight, eating healthier, exercising etc and was doing well, lost over 2 stone over 9 month  and then came down with this. I also find it frustrating that I have got this because I like my food, and I can not have some of my favourites anymore I hardly drink alcohol before and dont do drugs and dont smoke. Just annoying.

This is good news for you.   So you can relax.However, since you have heard nothing about your stool test, I would keep phoning your surgery to chase up these results.   They should not be taking this long.  This is the only way of getting reassurance.  My stool test result was late in coming through too.  I was very anxious about it so I kept ringing my surgery until I got answers.  The receptionist tried to fob me off about what she could and couldn’t tell me.  I explained that I was not  expecting her to tell me detailed information and all I wanted to know was if the result was negative or positive.  She then told me that my result was negative.    Persistence works.

I am going to eat bland stuff again, i have told my mum this. Couldn’t really hage bland stuff yesterday as she had already done the stew.

Also got a horrible taste in my mouth. Ended up having rice and chicken. Was plain rice. I am starting to get a little worried again by this. Especially now that the tablets dont seem to work. It says on the packaging dont take any other similar medicines like gaviscon for a number of hours after having the tablets.

Has made me feel sick as well. Havent been sick just made me feel it.I am on Lansoprazole 15mg gastro-resistant capsules 1 to be taken 30-60mins before food. I take it in the morning, roughly the same time each day. I have not been having any other medication with it. On the box it says something about dont take any other digestion type meds for a period of time, I will ask doctor about that on wed.

That is why it is written on the patient leaflet.  Trust and follow that information. You should wait four hours.    However, do not worry; anxiety will make your heartburn worse.  I have heartburn most of the time and I do not worry.  You may need a different PPI or a stronger dose.

In the case of gum, it is not swallowed, so the stomach may produce gas when no food arrives.  Chewing gum gives me gas.If you have digestive difficulties, it is better not to eat anything that can upset your digestion with gas.  Try some other sweet to change the taste in your mouth. However, if you take antacids, this will get rid of the acid and so you dhouldn’t get a sour acid taste in your mouth.

But I had only had my tablet yesterday morning.Saturday, as been easier than friday, still got a bit of pain. But the horrid taste isnt as bad. Also today I did have my tablet and gaviscon, not at the same time. But still had both. To eat i had scrambled egg on toast. Soup. Pasta, then chewed the chewing gum. To drink tea, water and milk. Just going to stick to something similar until Wednesday. Luckily its in the morning, so i wont have my tablet, just in case. Also I should order some more on Wednesday but I will wait and see what the doctor says. Always try and get an early appointment with doctor just to get it over and done with. I hope she checks my stomach area again, just to see if everything is normal.

This is the way it is if your condition is chronic.  I have chronic stomach trouble but medication and not worrying about it help.    All you can do is see what your doctor says.

Its deffo worse at night as this morning had some grilled bacon with an egg and toast and had no trouble, had my tablet roughly half an hour before, maybe a bit longer. But this evening had rice, veg and soup mixed together and felt it then.But going to continue to eat bland foods at least until i see the doctor anyway. And have gaviscon after evening meal and before bed

For example, have soup in the afternoon and vegetables in the evening. Or have vegetables one day and soup on another day.  Sometimes putting all these foods together, can cause digestive problems.  When having soup, try cooking it from fresh rather than buying shop varieties which can contain preservatives and other ingredients that your are sensitive to.  Freshly made soup is better because you know what you are putting into it.Try doing a food diary when having vegetables to see if any of them are causing symptoms.  Some vegetables are hard to digest.  It sounds like you haven't got to grips with all your food triggers yet since you are still getting trouble after eating.  Ask your doctor to refer you to a dietician who will guide you with an eating plan that will suit the food sensitivities you have.

Having Spaghetti today.I know, peppers and red Onions, probably normal onions as well do not sit well with this. And probably acidic fruits like apples, even if that doesn’t set this off it woulds set my ibs off so im not risking it.I tend to have the same foods each week and nothing other than what I have mentioned as set me off. Bar had a slight pain after christmas pudding but only have that on Christmas and boxing day.I think what has triggered this off this time is just over eating 2 days straight just down to going out with friends.

Just watching what I eat. Good thing is eating bland foods, and only that will help lose some weight. .I am sure what did set this off was over eating, which I know now not to do again.

Just got to wait for the paperwork to come through in the post. Have you had that? Whats it like?

If you suffer from anxiety, a throat spray may be better because sedation can aggravate your anxiety and trigger depression.  I had light sedation and that was enough to cause me trouble.

I havent even got an appointment yet.Is it ok? I have looked on nhs website and say got to be off the tablets a while, if thats the case probably appointment will be around late feb early March. But the information seems to be reassuring. Just be hungry on that day, knowing my luck I will have a late appointment so will go all day without having food.After the appointment, do you just have light food like scrambled eggs or soup?From now will be on tablets until i get the appointment then read the details and then go from there.

I was not warned about the risk of bad reactions and when I reported them, I was fobbed off.Make sure you ask about all the risks, mild or severe.  Do not assume they will tell you everything you need to know.  They will only tell you the postive things and play down the negatives.You may even be better not having the procedure at all and just stick to taking your tablets.   If nothing shows on your endoscopy, you may be advised just to manage your symptoms with tablets as you are doing.Many people here say their endoscopy was fine with sedation but everyone is different and it is better to say that there can be a different side to the story.I was not advised about not taking medication or food before the procedure.  My endoscopy was quite early in the morning.  So simply follow the advice you get on your paperwork and ask lots of questions.

If I have any questions I can ring the hospital up and be told then. I read they take your glasses off you, I hope they pretty much guide you in then as I wont be able to see much that isn’t blurred.It was my decision really to have it done. Just to rule anything or confirm anything as well.Probably my Grandad will take me and depending on what it says in the paperwork I might say you can drop me off and pick up. As I can not drive. I will hopefully just try with the throat spray only

Think its just down because I am going to hospital for a procedure and dont know what to expect. When you had yours, did you have to stop your antiacids/heartburn medication?But, the pain isn’t that bad now, can feel it every now and then.

I know once I had an appointment for 9.30, got there around 9.20 and didn’t go into see the dentist until 10:15, I was all paid up by 10:20.I think its only natural to get nervous as you dont know what to expect. Oh right, I just thought you would pretty much just walk in from the reception area, put on a gown or something then get taken through and told to the lie on the bed  and then just follow the drs orders.

I can’t take adrenaline injections and if I don’t get numbing gel, to help with the injection, I end up feeling too much pain and then I panic. The nerves in my mouth get inflamned and I end up back at the dentist within four days with raging toothache sometimes caused by an infection.  Then I have to watch what antibiotics I get because the common one amoxicillin makes me sick and others also give me stomach upsets.  All this can now trigger IBS.  At least I have an understanding dentist.With endoscopies, you are given a bed in the ward first and the gastroenterologist will explain the procedure to you.

At the time, I was seeing another doctor to the one I am now, but I did not feel nervous, I liked the doctor, just one of them things. I had to check my blood pressure at home for 2 weeks and it was pretty steady and normal, go to the doctors and it was high again.For saying I did not sleep very well on Tuesday-Wednesday, didnt get to sleep till after 3 and was up at 7.30. Last night I could not get to sleep until 1 and then woke up at normal time. Thought/wanted a lie in but no. Woke up with bubbling in my stomach, had my tablet about half an hour ago, got to get something to eat now, so will see how it goes.

She asked if I had been running but I said I had only been walking briskly to make sure I was on time and didn’t want to run because I didn’t want to be out of breath.  She gave me a funny look when I said that. I rather suspect, I was uptight and that was why my pulse was racing.

But got a a dull ache toward the right side. Sometimes I don’t feel like I want to eat but think its more anxiety more than anything. Yesterday was going to have a chicken baguette and soup for my dinner. But only had a few sips of soup, as I did not like it and ate the baguette. Today having chicken and rice with some veg.

I know it’s your decision but I found I had anxiety before the procedure, during the scope and then the huge side effects afterwards and nothing was found.  Some people still worry even if their endoscopy comes up clear especially if they still have symptoms.I was told I probably had a week oesophageal sphincter which could be fixed with surgery.  However, given my anxiety levels,  my hyper sensitivities to sedation, (I am even worse after general anaesthesia) and the length of time I take to recover from post op pain, I decided to treat my reflux with medication instead and it works.  Due to my Aspergers, my body doesn’t tolerate any invasive procedure very well and my immune system sets off a huge inflammatory response which doesn’t always settle down.Anxiety won’t help your stomach pain either.  I would speak to your doctor about your worries about the procedure and ask if she thinks it’s necessary.  I wasn’t on any antacids at the time of my procedure and I wasn’t given any info about coming off medication beforehand.  Ask your doctor about this or wait until your paperwork comes through and it probably will tell you there.  You may have to come off your stomach medications.

Plus then the doctors will have a better idea what is wrong and how to improve it.Doctor did mention it could be a type of hernia. Which would make sense as from what I remember when I first started with this I did not have any pain on the first day on my right side until I was being sick and was bringing nothing up due to having an empty stomach so was really pulling on that area. But we will see.At the moment feel full and bloated. Probably down to having rice, veg and chicken. I only felt sick while eating and slightly after I finished.

It is possible to have both of these conditions.  I think that being sick would be more likely to cause a pulled muscle rather than an abdominal hernia.  Abdominal henias tend to be caused by intense presure to the area caused by very heavy lifting.over a long period of time.  If you had one, you would see and feel a lump in the area.

But both blood and stool tests came back fine.Starting to feel the pain under my centre rib cage. Over 4 hours after eating last. Only started feeling it tonight after brushing my teeth. hope something can be done or at least get it back under control.

This is upper digestive and is not the same as an abdominal hernia.

Deffo worse at night. Checked to see if I could get another appointment with doctor but can’t get in until a week on Tuesday. Its a weird feeling around the centre of the ribcage down feels tight and achey, and stomach area feels bloated yet hungry and kidda bubbly too.

Its was blooming horrible but if it works. Also go a hot water on my stomach. Biggest pain ive got is where the dog landed in me in my groin area. Stomach is grumbling now as well. So might have something.

Even though my blood test what I had in November early December came back fine and stool test done late December came back fine as well. Havent had the letter from hospital through yet either. When I start to think about everything I start to feel sorry for myself which makes everything worse, so got to stop thinking like that.

Think I am/was worried about the endoscopy, and probably made it worse, but I dont think the tablets work full day, probably start to wear off around tea time. Glad I have got an appointment though with my doctor can tell her what happened since Wednesday, and I have lost around half a stone in a week, but, I havent been having snacks or unhealth things, just bland like things rice, spaghetti, eggs, soup, chicken and veg. And for drink just tea, water and milk. Also had a camomile tea(horrible) BUT I can not remember if I had my jeans on last week, if I did I wouldve had a belt with a metal buttle and they are heavier than jogging bottoms. The first time for a while I can remember my stomach is making bubbling noises and growning noises like normal.

What you get when you have a young springer spaniel. That happened on Wednesday as well, everything happened on Wednesday, that ache and the bubbling in my stomach and generally feeling blah at night

Woke up and my stomach near the rib cage feels really sore. Had my tablet but I don’t think it is helping much. Got a horrible taste in my mouth again and it’s making me feel sick.  Plus towards where the stomach ends that hurts as well. In two minds whether to nip to the walk in centre in the next town. But I have got an appointment with doctor Monday morning.

So  that couldve set it off again. But has been playing up abit before. Can you remember how long it took for your referral to come through?I’ve accepted that I am going to have the camera, but just got to decide whether to have the sedative or not.

Diet and stress management I think is the key to coping with your symptoms.I had private endoscopy but I can’t remember how long it took for my referral.  It would have been quicker than an NHS appointment. It was such a long time ago and to be honest, I think I blanked a lot of it out because of my bad experience with it.Sedation is not a good idea if you have anxiety and depression because it can actually increase it.  It plays on your sensitive side.  I would ask for the throat spray.  However, if you are worrying about the procedure, I would ask yourself if it is really a good idea for you since the thought of it is upsetting your stomach.There are alternatives to endoscopies such as a barium meal which doesn’t require sedation.

I can discuss the sedative or the spray with the nurse when having or with doctor on Monday.I have wrote down what my symptoms are on a piece of paper to not forget them.Just trying to relax at the moment by watching videos.

Texted my friend and been on a walk around our country park. Been out nearly 4 hours.Probably/ hopefully will get some stronger tablets. I told my mum id probably feel better if i felt like i was improving, instead either feel same or worse

Checked my stomach again and couldnt feel any lumps or bumps.Because I had just ordered some more tablets she said take 2 in the morning and then if you need to take one at night so will be Lansoprazole 45mg gastro-resistant a day instead of Lansoprazole 15mg gastro-resistant.Also said about to try and fast track for the camera as well. I wrote all my symptoms down and said to myself must ask if need to stop medication if having the camera, and I forgot about that bit.

Got it a little later, but, already had my tablets so had a polo mint. Just woke feeling a little bloated. Will continue with the tablet at night for a while.Still a little pain.

Record everything you eat and any symptoms that crop up. Then avoid the foods that irritate your stomach.  One of the reasons why you are still having trouble could be that you haven’t yet found a diet plan that suits your stomach.

Think today, I feel more down.Not sure about tomatoes, sometimes i get a dull ache sometimes i don't.Im being treated more for acid reflux I think. Woke up not as bloated today, just the sharp pain just lower right of my belly button.Good thing is i am not in as much discomfort now than last week.

You need a coping mechanism of some sort to help you to deal with past memories that upset you.I find dealing with past, hurtful memories very hard too and in my case I think this has contributed to my GI problems.  Now that I know getting stressed about the past can trigger my IBS, I try to satirise and poke fun at the situation or the individuals that caused me annoyance in a Limerick.  It is a great way of letting off steam.A counsellor should be able to suggest techniques that would work for you. Everyone has there own way of dealing with it.   Some people think pretending the event hasn't happened solves it for them.  For me, denying something hurtful has taken place only papers over the cracks and doesn't deal with the situation at its root.

I will try and get to the drs or hospital walk in centre as it could be my appendix

I would see your doctor straight away to organise counselling because that will help to calm your stomach down.  In the meantime, try some painkillers to ease your pain.Did your doctor suspect a grumbling appendix? If she ruled that out, I wouldn't worry about it.

Plus I havent got any other major symptoms. Just seeing how i go.I mean get the pain under control first and then go for it.

If there wasn’t severe pain, that’s probably why she wasn’t concerned.  If she thought it was your appendix, she would have referred you for a CT.  i would take painkillers for the pain.

Comes and goes throughout the day really. That was my guess as well. Think she asked the questions was pretty sure itbwasnt anything to do with my appendix then pressed and that ruled it out. But at least i know the signs

Im nearly 26. And my mind raced through - your going bald - people will make fun of you - wont be able to get a girlfriend etc.How do I go about getting help?  Without going back to my doctor?

I have a mop haircut at the moment so will probably have it cut shorter so i style it a little and try and hide it. Doesn’t help that its dry at the moment, will comb it differently and use a little gel or something to hold it. I told my mum as well.I have signed up for talking therapy. Just got to wait again. Its in the next town along at the local hospital, i think. Again I told my mum about it and said hopefully this will help me.Think i just worry about what people will say. As I dont know that many people I automatically go back to when I was at school and I haven’t seen nearly all of them for 10years. Which is daft but I cant help it. I think i worry that I haven’t got a girlfriend as the one thing i want in life is to have kids and some of my family members are having kids this year. I think also because I have been struggling with my mental health and general health for a while that does not help. Plus I haven’t got any money either and again people i went to school with are getting there own places as well as family members of a similar age. Its like I have put that pressure on me. Thank you for keep messaging me and helping me. I appreciate it.

My dad runs the house and I use my money to enjoy myself buying clothes or meeting friends.  When do have to start having more household responsibilities, I’ll handle it when it comes.  For now, I’m keeping that prospect on the back burner.Male pattern baldness will likely affect your friends too so they will be in the same in the end. You are not the only young man to go through it; you’re not alone.Good luck with the therapy when it comes.

Which has been happening to me.I do think about if i will meet anyone and eventually have kids. But I don’t have really anything to offer anyone, and I think that is in the back of my mind as well. I keep telling myself that I am 25 and still have time. Think its just hard seeing your ex friends be in the position you want to be in. But I keep telling myself i am 25 and 2 of my cousins were both in there mid 30s before they had kids. Then my mind wonders again and say they both had good jobs and homes by that time as well.  Its a real viscous circle. Sometimes i do have dark thoughts because I can not see a future. But then try and do something or be in the company of either my mum or brother. My minds a mess

You have plenty of time.  Quality time with your family can also be great.

So got that to wait for and the endoscopy, been 8 days since doctor bringing it up and 3 days since was going to fast track.  Its a weird feeling when the post comes because i want it to come and yet i dont.Going to have some spaghetti and chicken for tea, then go for a long bath and watch something.I just been having problems wanting to do things. A battery in my clock as gone and I cant be bothered to change it eventhough I know I should. Same with a pc tower. We got a new for downstairs which I set up downstairs and I got the old one, its over 10 years old, still runs xp, there is enough room behind my tv so was going to put it there. That was probably 4 weeks ago this Saturday first 2 weeks my stomach was playing up but last week i just could not be bothered

Also doesnt help that the light is right above the mirror. But made me feel a little better, got to accept it and carry on as I can not afford any special shampoo or tablets or transplants. Just got to try and hide it.Contacted the samaritans and some other mental health charity for help or information that could improve my depression/anxiety.Stomach, continuing with the 3 tablets a day for a while. Generally the pain hasnt been that bad today, just feel it every now and then.

I wasn’t able to hold down a proper job because of it so I try now to concentrate on my writing which keeps me calm and my IBS in check.  I have developed a habit of trying to laugh at commotions more.I have been with my boyfriend for around ten years and he keeps me anused too.

Think at the moment that is my worst fear which is making me feel down, then my stomach and then everything else. I think if i had some money that would help as I could do more and be in a position i thought i would be in now. Or at least feel more comfortable and confident to try and get a girlfriend. Had an ok nights sleep. I have been lucky really when it comes to sleep when i have an anxiety/ depression attack as when  i fall asleep i normally stay a sleep until aroun 6-7 then manage to nod off again for a little while. Its just getting to sleep that can be the problem. Atm mainly because I saw my scalp through my hair

Just be yourself.  I doubt people will even notice you have changed your hairstyle to hide a thin patch.  Worry can make hair loss worse.  I used to have a small patch at front of my hairline that would appear during exam stress and then grow in again after the exam period.  A lot of men hide hair loss; it is perfectly normal to this.

At the moment i have changed my parting and you cant see anything underneath. Before i had my hair hair flat and combed abit either side so parting was down the middle and if i combed straight I could see my scalp down thr centre in certain light. But it doesn’t help that the bathroom mirror is right below the light. Plus when I noticed it my hair was dry and looked greasy.Good news about the mental healtg therapy, self referred on Thursday and got the appointment yesterday for 5th March. It is only a telephone appointment to begin with but that will determine what therapy will be best for me.Still eating bland foods. Stomach mainly hurts in two places, but trying not to think about it. Havent got the letter yet for thr appointment, when the one for therapy came I thought that was it as it said “private and confidential” probably could get that letter next week as trying to be fastracked by my GP.Yesterday I did go for a walk around our country park with my dad. Was a good walk, over 10k again. Then in evening went to see my grandparents, so was talking more. Going to try and go for a walk with my brother later today, won’t be as far though.

I let them know i am not very well at the moment, but I have not felt like doing it. I know I have got to do things but i just can not be bothered and sooner try and get out of tge house for a while. Yesterday me and my dad was out the house fir nearly 4hours, i know tomorrow me and my friend are doing pretty much the same walk, not sure if he will be driving us ti the park, but if he does then that will knock iff about 1.5k each way.At the moment i am not really thst bothered about therapy, i sm kind of looking forward to it as hopefully it can improve my mental health snd get me better. Worst part is the telephone appointment, hopefully we can both understand one another, wouldve preferred a proper face to face one but that could’ve probably taken longer, the centre as been really helpful though, i have had a few questions so dropped them an email and i heard back from them in a few hours. In the meantime I have been incontact with the samaritans for additional general talk and support. I might try and watch Benidorm on netflix, eventhough i watched it not long ago, it is a colourful warm show and is funny in tge earlier seasons.

Because I play pokemon go, you can get an idea on how far you walk. We used the short cuts and from our house to the park it is 1.8k so did that there and back, then walked between 3-4k around a old theme park. So in 2 days walked around 15k+ and will do another 10k tomorrow.Ive got to try and stop checking my hair. It is a little thinner but if I comb  my hair over one side you cant tell. You cant really tell unless under bright light, and really the light in the bathroom is only around 2 foot above my head. Mainly just the parting. Got to stop checking using my phone or mirrors or even reflections in cars really. What i think i will do to do this is treat myself with something like a video game or dvd or something like that, what do you think of that idea?Stomach, been ok had pasta for my tea, Only really had pain on the lower right side. Some discomfort under rib cage but mainly on right side. Just going to have my last tablet of the day and then a bite to eat ( due to tablet)  wash teeth, and relax.

I know my lower right stomach area was hurting.I think tonight i am going to write a list of things i want to do tomorrow to try and get it done and have something to aim for.Today, going to have some breakfast, go for a walk with my friend most of the day, get back have some dinner, sit down and let mu dinner settle, have a bath, tablet, food and relax. Going to ask my brother to watch something with me but I think he is going to the gym at night.I think generally I feel down and then with things like my stomach and seeing what looks to be thinning hair it as made me feel worse.Throughout the day if I am not doing anything I do feel like I want to cry.

Last week when i got back i felt not as down this time feel the same really. I think it was down to not talking as much as his younger brother came with us so he has got to look after him, which is obviously the correct thing to do.

But when i see my doctor I will tell her. The walk yesterday I didnt enjoy so much because there waa a lot of families about or couples, plus I wasn’t speaking as much.I think today i am just going to have 1 stomach tablet in the morning and 1 at night. If it gets worse i can go back to 2 in the morning and 1 at night.Just checked post and haven’t got the letter yet.Going to ask my brother to go on a walk again and hopefully watch something at night, as we did last night.

Same day I got a letter about the camera, been waiting for a while and turns out the appointment is just a telephone call for this Monday. From when I started taking 3 tablets a day I was ok so, worked down to just 2, 30mg. Went to get my tablets yesterday and it didnt go through because It was for a 2 month but because doctor told me to double it or even have 3, it did not change on my prescription, which i have got to go bck later today to hopefully pick them up. Which i will need as my stomach as started to ache and hurt again. Despite eating relatively bland

At the moment, I am going through a quarter life crisis. So that doesnt help with my depression and anxiety.

Do hida scan to see if your gallbladder is working or not and then the ultrasound for any stones.

I have gastritis and don't think mine can be cured as 8 have developed metaplasia and that is not good but you could probably get rid of it with careful diet. Kefir is good as it a probiotic and you need that as it's anti inflammatory and turmeric is anti inflammatory but don't take and same time as any PPItablets, u take PPI in am and turmeric a few hours later. You can join the Tumeric users website and it gives you info about how to use it. Good luck, sounds as it you can catch it early.  1
